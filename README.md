# Clean Sheet DQN
Using (hopefully) only the original paper, implement the DQN algorithm and compare results with OpenAI's Spinning Up implementation of the same algorithm.

## Original Paper
The original paper, [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](http://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236), by Minh et al. introduces the concept of a deep Q-network which can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. 

## Implementation
Using [Pytorch](http://papers.neurips.cc/paper/9015-pytorch-an-imperative-style-high-performance-deep-learning-library.pdf) to implement the deep Q-network as described in the paper.
